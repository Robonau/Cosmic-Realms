Known Issues (I don't feel like looking into & you should if you want to use this source.)
--------

-Conditional Effects do not display on Players but only on Enemies. //"Damage" GameObject.as
-Fps lag whenever you move your mouse around. Use Adobe Scout to assist in this fix. //"attemptAttackAngle" in MapUserInput.as
-Remove Moon Closing becuase it is not done yet. //Moon.cs
-Fix TQ command not working. //RankedCommands.cs "Tq"
-Fix Chat Scaling to 0 on default. - I should have fixed this but i cannot test.
